# ML/DL Inference as a Dockerized REST API
### Instruction to follow

* Install Docker engine.
*   Add the files/folders required only for inference in src directory
* Add the files required for input (if any) in src/data/input 
* Add the model checkpoints in src/checkpoints dir
* Generate a yaml file with your conda environment with the command:
```
conda env export > <environment-name>.yml
```
* Add the packages that are hard to install with the installation commands in additional-softwares.sh
* Rename the filenames and environment names in Dockerfile
* Rename the inference file name in api.py
* Change the inference file( that you call in api.py) so that it accepts input from arguments.
* In case of using input files from tmp change the code to read the input files from tmp directory.
* Run api.py with the above changes:
```
    python api.py
```
* If there are no errors then create a docker image with the command:
```
    docker build -t <image-name> .
```
* Run the image with:
```
    docker run -p 5000:5000 <image-name> 
```
#### Test the /hi endpoint
* Use Pythonâ€™s requests library to send an HTTP POST (with an empty JSON body) to your service and print the result:
```
import requests
from requests.structures import CaseInsensitiveDict

url = "http://localhost:5000/hi"

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers["Accept"] = "application/json"
headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
headers["Content-Length"] = "0"


resp = requests.post(url, headers=headers)
print(resp)
# Print status, headers and pretty-printed JSON body
print("Status code:", resp.status_code)
print("Headers:", resp.headers)
print("Body:",resp.text)
#print(json.dumps(resp.json(), indent=2)) #uncomment if it is a json response
```
